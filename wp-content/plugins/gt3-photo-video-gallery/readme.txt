== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add video to the photo gallery using plugin? =
The Lite version of this plugin supports Youtube and Vimeo. The Pro one supports also self-hosted videos. To add the video to the photo gallery, please click any image in the gallery editor, you will get a WordPress popup window where you can add the url to the video on the right side of the page where the title, caption and other info is available.

= Is your photo gallery compatible with Gutenberg? =
Yes. Our photo gallery is fully compatible with Gutenberg editor. We've created a custom gallery block which allows you to add the images to any page, post etc. The gallery blocks has its custom settings like in the previous WordPress versions. While adding the Gutenberg block, please put GT3 and you will get our gallery block in the entire blocks list.

= Can we use your photo gallery in WPBakery page builder? =
Yes, you can add our GT3 photo gallery using the standard content module. You will be able to modify the gallery via the classic WordPress media. Just click edit image galllery in the content editor, you will get a popup window with the option to modify the photo gallery. The custom photo gallery modules are available in Pro version.

= Can we use your photo gallery in Elementor page builder? =
Yes, since version 2.4.1.3 you can add photo gallery (grid and masonry) using Elementor page builder photo gallery widget. You will get the same functionality as in the Gutenberg gallery block.

= Can we use your photo gallery in Divi page builder? =
At the moment it's not possible to use it within Divi page builder because it requires a custom module which must be integrated into builder. We will do its integration asap. You will be notified.

= Can we use your photo gallery in Beaver pgae builder? =
At the moment it's not possible to use it within Beaver page builder because it requires a custom module which must be integrated into builder. We will do its integration asap. You will be notified.

= Can we use your photo gallery in the custom post types? =
Yes, you can do that. Our image gallery is based on the standard WordPress gallery functionality, so you can use it in the custom post types and blog post formats. Please note that CPT should have a classic or Gutenberg editor support.

= What happens with our existing galleries if we remove the plugin? =
The main idea of the plugin was to keep your galleries on the website even if you remove our plugin. If you disable or remove the plugin all your galleries will be loading on the website. The only difference, they will have a standard WordPress gallery look.

= How can we categorize the galleries? Is it possible to do that? =
You can't do that at the moment. We are going to create a custom post type GT3 Galleries where you can add the different categories and display them on the website. You will also be able to create galleries with the categories and filter them using iSotope. This option will be available in Pro version.

= The images are loading slowly. What should we do? =
It happens because of the uploaded image size. Very often the people upload the original images to the media higher than Full HD, in this case the size of the image can reach up 8-10MB. If you have for example 10 images on the page the page size will be approximately 80MB which causes the slow page loading. For such users we've created GT3 Image Optimizer, it opimizes all your media library to Full HD format. You can read more about it on our website.

= How can I link the image to external link? =
Yes, we have this option available in Pro version of this photo gallery plugin. You can easily add the external URL/link to any image from the image gallery.
